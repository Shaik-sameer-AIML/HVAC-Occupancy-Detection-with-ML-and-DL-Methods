# HVAC-Occupancy-Detection-with-ML-and-DL-Methods
```
1. Introduction
For this kernel, I'm using a dataset for predicting room occupancy with using environmental observations such as temperature, humidity and CO2 level. This predictions might help Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) sector. For instance, we are using sensors like thermostats to get information about the environment and with that info our system decides to heat or not situation. But if the thermostat set manually by a occupant before and there is no more occupants in the environment, what then? The system won't shutdown until it gets set values, and this situation will lead high energy consumption.

## Installation

1. Install the required python libraries:
2. 
   ```shell
   !pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn
3. Install the required packages:

   ```shell
   pip install keras
4. If you face any issues related to GPU support or TensorFlow installation, you might need to install specific versions or configure GPU drivers.

## Usage

1. Navigate to Google Colab and Create a new notebook.
   ```shell
   https://colab.research.google.com/
   ```

2. Upload the dataset of four classes to Google drive (The dataset has the FUNDUS images of eye).
    ```
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```

3. After uploading the dataset in the Google Drive, Mount Drive with the Google Colab repository.

4. Execute the Fundus Disease Detection script in the Colab notebook, which may involve adapting the script to run within a notebook environment.

5. Make sure that the Retinopathy Disease Prediction script runs within the Colab notebook environment and required packages are installed in the Colab environment using the following commands.
    ```
    !pip install package_name
    ```

6. Display the prediction results directly within the Colab notebook.

7. Include visualizations, such as predicted classes or probability scores, to enhance result interpretation.

8. Repeat the process by providing new inputs, changing the optimizer, Ephocs and with different Fundus images.

### Mathematical Equations
#### 1. Accuracy:
The accuracy measures the overall correctness of the classification model. It is
the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.

```
Accuracy = Number of Correct Predictions/Total Number of Predictions
```

#### 2. Precision:
Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total
predicted positives. It is a measure of how many of the predicted positive
instances are actually positive.
```
Precision = True Positives/True Positives + False Positives
```

#### 3. F1 Score:
The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance
between the two metrics.
```
F1 Score = 2×(Precision×Recall/Precision + Recall)
```
4. Confusion Matrix:
The confusion matrix is a table that describes the performance of a classification
model. It contains information about true positive, true negative, false positive,
and false negative predictions.
~~~
[True Negative (TN) False Positive (FP)
False Negative (FN) True Positive (TP)]
~~~
5. Loss Function:
A loss function, in the context of machine learning, quantifies the difference
between the predicted values generated by a model and the actual ground truth,
serving as a measure of the model's performance during training.
~~~
Lcross-entropy(xi) = -(yi log(f(xi))+(1-yi)log(1-f(xi)))
~~~
